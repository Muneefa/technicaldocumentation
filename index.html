                <strong>JAVA SCRIPT</strong> JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.

                JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
                
                Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
                Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.

                JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript
                language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript
                follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the
                reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.

                In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a
                runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.
                JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The
                prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual
                objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can
                be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.

                JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables,
                classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
                protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types
                are not explicitly typed.

                Psychologists generally do not characterize human intelligence by
                just one trait but by the combination of many diverse abilities.
                Research in AI has focused chiefly on the following components of
                intelligence: learning, reasoning, problem solving, perception, and
                using language.

            This simple memorizing of individual items and procedures known as
            rote learning is relatively easy to implement on a computer. More
            challenging is the problem of implementing what is called
            generalization. Generalization involves applying past experience to
            analogous new situations. For example, a program that learns the
            past tense of regular English verbs by rote will not be able to
            produce the past tense of a word such as jump unless it previously
            had been presented with jumped, whereas a program that is able to
            generalize can learn the “added” rule and so form the past tense of
            jump based on experience with similar verbs.

                You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called
                identifiers, conform to certain rules.

                A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent
                characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the
                characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).

                You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode
                escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and
                _name.

            The most significant difference between these forms of reasoning is
            that in the deductive case the truth of the premises guarantees the
            truth of the conclusion, whereas in the inductive case the truth of
            the premise lends support to the conclusion without giving absolute
            assurance.

                You can declare a variable in three ways:
                With the keyword var. For example,
            </p>
            <div class="code">
                <code>
                var x = 42.

                This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.By simply assigning it a value. For
                example,

            <div class="code">

                This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this
                variant.

            </p>
            <div class="code">

                    same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.
                    undefined.
                <li>A top-level property whose value is undefined.
                    Number. 42 or 3.14159.

                    Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015).</li>
